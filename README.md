### LEAF CLASSIFICATION USING DEEP LEARNING MODELS

In this project we have implemented 8 models namely 
* ResNet18
* EfficientNet
* MnasNet
* MobileNetV3
* ShuffleNetV2
* SqueezeNet
* AlexNet (not ready to use in the repository, but can be trained for usage)
* VGG19 (not ready to use in the repository, but can be trained for usage)
